# Bangkit-Onikku-C23-PS044

Hi everyone! 

Onikku is an application made by the C23-PS044 team for Bangkit Academy 2023 Batch 1 Capstone Project.
This app is made to accommodate people's need to sort their household wastes and make a biodegradable product out of it with the provided recommendation.

This is a very simple app hence the user can just take a picture of their waste and upload it to know what's the recommended method to recycle their waste. Other than that, the app also provides the user with the location of the nearest waste banks just in case they can not process the waste on their own. 

We build the machine learning model of this project using Google Colab Environment due to some limitations of our devices. The machine learning model is built with Tensorflow as the framework to classify household waste. 


  Our **final code** can be seen through [Final Code Onikku](https://github.com/Boedi27/Bangkit-Onikku-C23-PS044/blob/ML/ML_Onikku_Final_accuracy_82.ipynb)


  While our **dataset** can be accessed through [Dataset Onikku](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bzBNiePz_vq86dzwNGpiKfQTw99dAWmM)


  The very **final model** in .h5 format can be accessed through [Final Model Onikku](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kp6Yu-eyoqMGfWy0XM0eFZs1GepWmcNY/view?usp=drive_link)


  The above model is then deployed by the Cloud Computing members through the links below:
